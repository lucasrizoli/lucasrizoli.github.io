# Accessibility in Games Resources

## Definitions
> **Accessibility** (aka. a11y) is the aspect of the design and realization of a game that avoids, reduces, and removes barriers that affect players with disabilities. **Disabilities** are the issues that come from the interaction of players' bodies—vision, hearing, motor skills, cognitive abilities, etc.—and the features of the game.

> Many design solutions for accessibility (1) communicate information in more than one way—for example, teams are shown with distinct colours and icons—and (2) allow players some flexibility in how they interact or experience the game—for example, how controls are mapped, whether subtitles are on/off, and changes to game difficulty.
