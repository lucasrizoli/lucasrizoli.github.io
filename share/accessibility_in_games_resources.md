# Accessibility in Games Resources

## Definitions
> **Accessibility** (aka. a11y) is the aspect of the design and realization of a game that avoids, reduces, and removes barriers that affect players with disabilities. **Disabilities** are the issues that come from the interaction of players' bodiesâ€”vision, hearing, motor skills, cognitive abilities, etc.â€”and the features of the game.

> Many design solutions for accessibility (1) communicate information in more than one wayâ€”for example, teams are shown with distinct colours and iconsâ€”and (2) allow players some flexibility in how they interact or experience the gameâ€”for example, how controls are mapped, whether subtitles are on/off, and changes to game difficulty.

> Remember, many accessibility features may not suit you. They are often *made for someone else*, in a different circumstance, for whom they *are* suited and *do* look right.
